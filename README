ECL lisp to perl binding.
Other lisps (SBCL, CLISP) are not embeddable and could be used from perl
very differently.
ECL could be used as a module, so here is the binding.

INSTALLATION

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

DEPENDENCIES

"ecl-config" command should be in path at moment of running Makefile.PL,
which tells path to INC and LIBs
